# Dining at Lindy's

"A number of 'Waiter ...' jokes are attributed to the notoriously rude waiters at Lindy's Restaurant in New York. Lindy's was started in August 1921 by Leo Lindemann and was as famous for the backchat of its waiters as for its clientele of comics, gangsters, show-biz stars and other celebrities."

In this game, your job is to save Mr. Yum (or, Tom, to his friends) from drowning in your soup. By solving a series of puzzles, you'll be rewarded with a top-up in your soup bowl. Once the soup reaches the brim, Mr. Yum can reach for the edge and climb out.
